**AtliQ Hardwares Power BI Dashboard**


**Introduction**

Welcome to the AtliQ Hardwares Power BI Dashboard repository! This project represents the culmination of efforts to address critical challenges faced by AtliQ Hardwares, a rapidly growing electronic goods company in Latin America. The primary objective was to facilitate quick and data-driven decision-making by creating a dynamic Power BI dashboard tailored for the Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams.

**The Challenge**

AtliQ Hardwares encountered complex challenges in the Latin American market that necessitated rapid and informed decision-making based on data insights. To meet this challenge head-on, I undertook the task of developing an automated Power BI dashboard capable of providing real-time data analysis and valuable insights to various departments within the organization.

**Empowering Teams with a Dynamic Power BI Dashboard**

The culmination of this project is the successful implementation of a dynamic Power BI dashboard, empowering teams across AtliQ Hardwares to make data-driven decisions with ease. Leveraging my skills in data modeling, Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), data validation, and dashboard design, we processed and visualized over 1.8 million records. The result is a multifaceted dashboard that caters to the specific needs of the Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams, enabling them to unlock the full potential of their data.

**Key Learnings**

Throughout this project, I acquired a deep understanding of critical business terminologies, including Gross Price, Pre-Invoice Deductions, Post-Invoice Deductions, Net Invoice Sale, Gross Margin, Net Sales, Net Profit, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), YTD (Year to Date), and YTG (Year to Go). These terminologies played a pivotal role in crafting an effective dashboard tailored to the unique requirements of each team.

**Team-Specific Metrics**

Sales Team: The Sales Team primarily focuses on metrics such as gross margin and net sales (revenue), as they have limited control over operating expenses.

Marketing Team: The Marketing Team places great importance on tracking changes in marketing spend over time and how it impacts subsequent revenue. Additionally, they closely monitor gross margin and net profit.

Supply Chain Team: Forecast accuracy and risk management, including out-of-stock or excess stock risks, are top priorities for the Supply Chain Team. They pay meticulous attention to metrics like net error and absolute error to ensure smooth operations.

Understanding these team-specific metrics was instrumental in creating a tailored Power BI dashboard that provided actionable insights to each department.

The Power of Effective Communication

During this project, I gained a profound appreciation for the power of effective communication. Engaging with senior stakeholders and actively seeking their feedback allowed me to continually improve the dashboard and provide valuable insights to the company. Clear and open communication proved to be a key driver of success throughout the project.
